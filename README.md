# carried_bot

Unfortunatly, the tracker api limits the requests for VALORANT. Until this is opened, it will only work once per session. Otherwise, it works.

Discord bot for VALORANT stats. Use !tracker name#id to pull up some stats. These stats will be used to dictate whether or not you are carried in ranked.
